## Interactive Multiverse App

This folder contains code for a [Shiny App](https://pbloom.shinyapps.io/amygdala_mpfc_multiverse/) that contains interactive visualizations of the multiverse. 

The main application is in the `app.R` file, which sources the rest of the R scripts in this folder. The app is deployed publicly at https://pbloom.shinyapps.io/amygdala_mpfc_multiverse/

Note: as identifiable data have been removed before uploading these app files to Github, the scripts here will not run as-is without data.
